INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------
You only need to download the xml file unless you come across a folder. Then you need the whole folder. The .lua files are there so that I can lint/intellisense the Lua part.


DESCRIPTIONS
-------------------------------
Aardwolf_Disarmed.xml - Replaces your disarm triggers with a plugin! 'help disarm'
szz_new_character_statmon.xml - Replaces the default aard_statmon_gmcp.xml with a newer spiffier looking gmcp version with more info. ('ncs help' in game for more info.)
