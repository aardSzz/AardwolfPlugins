# INSTRUCTIONS
###### You only need to download the xml file unless you come across a folder. Then you need the whole folder. The .lua files are there so that I can lint/intellisense the Lua part.


# Aardwolf_Disarmed.xml 
### [NO WINDOW] 
###### Replaces your disarm triggers with a plugin! 'help disarm'. Now supports scripted events including offhand disarms.


# Aardwolf_Portal_Adder.xml 
### [NO WINDOW] (REQUIRES: AardMush, dinv plugin) 
###### addportal portalid# 

###### Get your portal out and id it. Copy the id. Put it back where you keep it. Use the command addportal id# and it'll take all steps to add your portal to mapper managing it with dinv.


# szz_new_character_statmon.xml
### [THEMEABLE, CUSTOMIZABLE] (REQUIRES: AardMush, GMCP)
###### Replaces the default aard_statmon_gmcp.xml with a newer spiffier looking gmcp version with more info. ('ncs help' in game for more info.)
